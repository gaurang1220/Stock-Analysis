# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using IBM Watsonx AutoAI
This project demonstrates how to use IBM Watsonx AutoAI to automatically train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting stock prices using historical market data.

The notebook leverages Python 3.11 and the ibm-watsonx-ai package to automate model training and comparison without requiring manual feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning.

âš  Note: This notebook does not include model deployment. It focuses only on building and evaluating models.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
To predict future stock closing prices (Close or Adj Close) based on historical features such as:

Opening price
